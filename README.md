Again, do not just memorize these algorithms and think you are suddenly a better developer for it. Software Engineering, first and foremost, is about being able to understand problems and build solutions. Learning algorithms isn’t important because you are going to have to exactly implement them for something you’re building. They are important because they teach you how to approach problems.

### Programming Techniques:

1. #### Recursion

- Function calls itself to solve a problem.

2. #### Store (Memoization)

- Speed up recursive functions by caching the results of function calls.

3. #### Bottom-up Solutions

- Iterative solutions that build up a solution to a problem from smaller subproblems.
- They are often used in dynamic programming.
