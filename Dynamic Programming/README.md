### Dynamic programming

A technique that breaks down problems into sub-problems, and saves the result for future purposes so that we do not need to compute the result again. It is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.

"Dynamic programming is like playing chess; each move depends on the previous one and leads to the next one until you reach your goal." - Dr. Richard Bellman
